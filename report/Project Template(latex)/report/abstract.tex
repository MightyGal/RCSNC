\paragraph{}
We are developing the proposed system for monitoring the networks. When we have a
group of computers interconnected, the administration and monitoring all these systems
are required. For this purpose we can use one computer called server computer. All
remaining computers are called client computers and are under the control of server
computer. Using server operating systems we can control  the client system. Although
we have server-operating systems to monitor the client machines, here we present a new
tool using which we can monitor and control the client machines very effectively. Remote
Cellular SMS Commander network tool can control remote PC systems with a mobile
phone device through using the SMS message services. There is no so conditions that
this mobile phone must be of a particular type or version. The only condition is, it must
support SMS inside the devices and can work with the network that provide the services
of SMS.
