This software is used to control the working of a computer using mobiles.It contains
mainly mobile phones and computers. User mobiles are connected to a central server,
and this central server forms a network of client PC's. The user can send the messages
using their respective mobile phones, which is connected to the central system. Based
on the request send by the user, the server system performs the task on their respective
client PC's.
The goal is to control the remote PC systems with a mobile phone device through
using the SMS message services. There is no condition that mobile phone must be of a
particular type or version.The only condition is they must support SMS inside the devices
and can work with the network they provide the services of SMS. 
This software enables users to use data and functions stored in/served by their office
PC's from anywhere with small mobile devices.

A GSM modem is a specialized type of modem which accepts a SIM card, and operates over a subscription to a mobile operator, just like a mobile phone. From the mobile operator perspective, a GSM modem looks just like a mobile phone.
When a GSM modem is connected to a computer, this allows the computer to use the GSM modem to communicate over the mobile network.  While these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile internet connectivity, many of them can also be used for sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages.
A GSM modem can be a dedicated modem device with a serial, USB or Bluetooth connection, or it can be a mobile phone that provides GSM modem capabilities.
For the purpose of this document, the term GSM modem is used as a generic term to refer to any modem that supports one or more of the protocols in the GSM evolutionary family, including the 2.5G technologies GPRS and EDGE, as well as the 3G technologies WCDMA, UMTS, HSDPA and HSUPA.

GSM modems can be a quick and efficient way to get started with SMS, because a special subscription to an SMS service provider is not required. In most parts of the world, GSM modems are a cost effective solution for receiving SMS messages, because the sender is paying for the message delivery.

\subsection{Existing System}
There does not exist a device to control the operation of a PC
in the network. So it is a very tedious procedure and the resource and manpower is very
high. We cannot fully control the operation of system in a specific time and work overload
of the employee is very high. Various factors for inventing the new proposed system is
\begin{itemize}

\item[1]Security 
\item[2]Resource utilization maximum
\item[3]Availability
\end{itemize}
Usually above given techniques are not integrated together into a single system.
\subsection{Proposed System}
We are developing the proposed system for monitoring the networks. When we have a
group of computers interconnected, the administration and monitoring all these systems
are required. For this purpose we can use one computer called server computer. All
remaining computers are called client computers and are under the control of server
computer. Using server operating systems we can control the privileges of the client user
by setting client access permissions and other settings specified in the domain. Although
we have server-operating systems to monitor the client machines, here we present a new
tool using which we can monitor and control the client machines very effectively. Remote
Cellular SMS Commander network tool can control remote PC systems with a mobile
phone device through using the SMS message services. Which can be done by using two
mobile phones, there is no so conditions that both mobile phones must be the same types or versions. The only condition is, they must support SMS inside the devices and can
work with the network that provide the services of SMS.
