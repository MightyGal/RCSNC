\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description on Remote Cellular
SMS based Network Commander. This software is used to control the working of a
computer using mobiles. It contains mainly mobile phones and computers. The user can
send the messages using their respective mobile phones, which is connected to the central
system. Based on the request send by the user, the server system performs the task on
their respective client PC's.
\subsubsection{Scope}
System described in this document is specifically designed for Remote Cellular SMS
based Network Commander. Scope of this project is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1]Ability to restart the computer
\item[2]Ability to shut down the computer
\item[3]Detect any USB connected
\item[4]Monitor activities in the system
\item[5]Notifications from leaders
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overall Description}
\subsubsection{Product Perspective}
This product is developed for monitoring the networks. When we have a group of
computers interconnected, the administration and monitoring all these systems are required. For this purpose we can use one computer called server computer. All remaining
computers are called client computers and are under the control of server computer. Using server operating systems we can control the privileges of the client user by setting
client access permissions and other settings specified in the domain. Although we have
server to monitor the client machines, here we present a new tool using
which we can monitor and control the client machines very effectively. Remote Cellular
SMS Commander network tool can control remote PC systems with a mobile phone device through using the SMS message services. There is no so conditions that the mobile
phone must be the particular type or version. The only condition is, it must support
SMS inside the devices and can work with the network that provide the services of SMS.
\subsubsection{Operating System Environment}
Java Platform, Standard Edition or Java SE is a widely used platform for programming
in the Java language. It is the Java Platform used to deploy portable applications for
general use. In practical terms, Java SE consists of a virtual machine, which must be
used to run Java programs, together with a set of libraries (or "packages") needed to
allow the use of file systems, networks, graphical interfaces, and so on, from within those
programs. NetBeans is a free, open-source Integrated Development Environment for
software developers.The NetBeans Platform is a reusable framework for simplifying the
development of other desktop applications.
\subsection{Functional Requirments}
The system presented in this document mainly consist of two modules, they are server
module and client module.
\subparagraph{}
Server module consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1]Connection management module: It is responsible for establishing connection between server and clients.
\item[2]Client session management module: It is responsible for managing the activities of
the client, that is it keep track of the client.
\item[3]Database Connectivity:It is responsible for managing database and handling queries.
\item[4]User management: Manages the users who are members of the network.
\item[5]SMS module: Responsible for receiving sms from the client which is in pdu format
and convert it in to text format.
\subparagraph{}
Client module consist of:
\item[1]Server request process unit: This modules handles the request received to server
such as login request,application run request etc.
\item[2]Client authentication module: Responsible for managing the authentication of client
who logs in.
\item[3]Client appilcation Module:Client application is always running on the system. This module responsible for viewing and coding of application.
\item[4]Application management: Manage client  applications.
\end{itemize}
